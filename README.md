# Java Physics Engine
This is a little physics engine that I wrote in java.

This was my first self taught project so some of the design concepts are improvised.

# Running it
to generate class files
```bash
   $ make
```

to run the simulation
```bash
   $ make test
```

to remove class files
```bash
   $ make clean
```
